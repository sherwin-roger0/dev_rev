# Movie Recommendation System Data Warehouse Project

The movie recommendation system data warehouse project aims to build an effective movie recommendation system based on users' viewing history. This project requires the collection, cleaning, and analysis of a movie dataset to create a data warehouse that can be used for data analysis and building the recommendation system.

## Dataset
The movie dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. The dataset includes information such as movie titles, release dates, genres, cast and crew, ratings, and user reviews.

## Project Steps

## Data Collection: Collect the movie dataset from a reliable source, such as Kaggle, and import it.

## Building the Recommendation System: Use the insights gained from the data analysis to build a movie recommendation system. The system should recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences.

## Project Deliverables
The final deliverables of the project should include a data warehouse that contains clean and analyzed data, and a movie recommendation system that can be used to recommend movies to users based on their viewing history and preferences in a website.

## Conclusion
The movie recommendation system data warehouse project is an exciting project that can be used to develop an effective recommendation system that can be used in various applications such as movie streaming platforms. This project requires data collection, cleaning, and analysis, and the use of techniques such as data visualization to gain insights into the user's viewing behavior and movie preferences. The final deliverables of the project should be a data warehouse and a movie recommendation system that can be used to recommend movies to users based on their preferences.
